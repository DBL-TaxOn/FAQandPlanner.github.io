          Income-tax is to be paid by every person. The term 'person' as defined under the Income-tax Act covers in its
          ambit natural as well as artificial persons.
           
          For the purpose of charging Income-tax, the term 'person' includes Individual, Hindu Undivided Families
          [HUFs], Association of Persons [AOPs], Body of individuals [BOIs], Firms, LLPs, Companies, Local authority and
          any artificial juridical person not covered under any of the above.
           
          Thus, from the definition of the term 'person' it can be observed that, apart from a natural person, i.e., an
          individual, any sort of artificial entity will also be liable to pay Income-tax.

          or gross receipts of the eligible business, for the previous year; 6% in case of electronic receipts) will be
          net income for the business covered under this scheme. However, Assessee can declare Higher Income. From the
          net income computed as above, an assessee is not permitted to claim any deduction under sections 30 to 38
          (including depreciation or unabsorbed depreciation). Major Benefit in this scheme is that assesse need not
          maintain books of accounts.
          </br></br><strong> Who can opt for this scheme?</strong></br></br>
          This scheme can be adopted by eligible resident individuals, resident Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) and
          resident partnership firms. However, limited liability partnership (LLP) firms are not allowed to adopt this
          scheme. The condition for opting this scheme is that your turnover should be less than ₹ 2 crores. Person
          earning income in the nature of Commission or brokerage, or Person carrying on any Agency business is not
          eligible for this scheme.
          </br></br><strong> 5 Years Lock in period Condition:</strong></br></br>
          If you are opting for the presumptive scheme, you must-
          </br> <strong>a.</strong> File presumptive scheme for at least 5 years in continuation.
          </br> <strong>b.</strong> If you decide to show and file profits as per regular business (ITR-3) before the
          end of these 5 years, you will lose presumptive benefits and disallowed from presumptive taxation for the
          subsequent 5 years.
          Please note that 5 years shall be counted starting the year in which you first file usual taxes for such
          business.
          The government is discouraging taxpayers from misusing the scheme and constantly changing their option often.
          So if you opt for presumptive continue for 5 years and if you want to opt out, you’ll be barred from resuming
          presumptive for a period of 5 years.
